            <em>The South Africa national rugby team, known as the Springboks,
            has one of the richest histories in world rugby with great successes and significant moments that have shaped the sport and the nation. 
            The Springboks have won the Rugby World Cup three times (1995, 2007, and 2019) and have been a dominant force in international rugby for over a century.
            The team's history is marked by legendary players, iconic matches, and a journey that reflects the social and political changes in South Africa, 
            making the Springboks not just a rugby team but a symbol of national pride and unity.</em>

          <p class="text">
            South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup, with a surge of support for the Springboks among the white and black communities behind the slogan "one team, one country.
            This was the first major international sports event to be held in the Rainbow Nation. 
            By the time they hosted the 1995 World Cup, the Springboks, coached by Kitch Christie, were seeded ninth. 
            They won their pool by defeating Australia, Romania, and Canada. 
            Wins in the quarter-final against Western Samoa (42–14) and in the semi-final against France (19–15) sent the Springboks to the final.
            South Africa won the 1995 Rugby World Cup final against the All Blacks 15–12 in extra-time.
            President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok shirt, presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, a white Afrikaner.
            The gesture was widely seen as a major step towards the reconciliation of white and black South Africans.

            At the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, the Springboks won their pool. 
            The Springboks then defeated Fiji 37–20 in the quarter-finals, and Argentina 37–13 in the semi-finals. 
            In the final they prevailed 15–6 over England to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time.

          <h3 class="section__title">Rassie Erasmus</h3>
          <p class="text">
            Following the sacking of Allister Coetzee in February 2018, 
            Rassie Erasmus was named head coach of the national team, alongside his duties as Director of Rugby at SA Rugby,
            on 1 March 2018 and immediately decided to appoint Siya Kolisi as the new Springbok captain, a landmark decision. <br>

            In his first match in charge, Erasmus awarded thirteen new players their first test cap, in a one-off match in Washington, D.C. in a 22–20 loss to Wales. 
            A week later, he secured his first win, a 42–39 victory over England, during their three-test series. 
            The series title was clinched in the second test, with the Springboks winning 23–12, to secure a series victory. 
            However, South Africa were unable to gain the clean-sweep, after losing the third test, 25–10. During the 2018 Rugby Championship,
             Erasmus led the Springboks to second, their best placing since 2014. The 2018 Championship saw South Africa win three games, including a thrilling
              36–34 victory over New Zealand in Wellington, South Africa's first win in New Zealand since 2009. Erasmus later revealed that had the Springboks
               lost that match, he would have resigned: <br><br>

            "We had recently lost to Australia and Argentina, and if we didn't win in Wellington I would have resigned ...
             I have never lost three games in a row as a coach and if I did that I don't deserve to be a Springbok coach. 
             We played New Zealand in Wellington and that was important, as if we lost it I wouldn't be here." <br><br>

            South Africa came within moments of reclaiming the Freedom Cup in the final round, but an All Black try in the dying moments of the game helped New Zealand snatch
             victory in 32–30 win in Pretoria and retain the cup.<br><br>
